In this project we have used journey Date,source ,Destination, total stops, departure and arrival time to predict flight price
We have extracted day and month from Date of journey,extracted hour and minute features from dep and arrival time. 
We have tried Decion tree , random forest and XGB regressor algorithms. 
We have got best accuracy with Randomforest ad got R2 score of 0.83
We have used flask framework to develop flight prediction web app
